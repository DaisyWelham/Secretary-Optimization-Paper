    "The secretary problem is a class of problems which works as follows:-\n",
    "- We are interviewing for a new secretary.\n",
    "- After each interview we must either \"hire\" the secretary and stop interviewing more secretaries, or \"reject\" the secretary and then we cannot hire them.\n",
    "- We can interview at most N secretaries.\n",
    "- We don't have data about the distribution of possible secretaries, but for any two secretaries we can decide which we prefer.\n",
    "\n",
    "For such problems, the known solution which gives the best chance of hiring the best secretary is:-\n",
    "- reject the first N/e secretaries\n",
    "- Then, hire the first secretary which is preferable to every secretary we have interviewed so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the solution to the secretary problem to build an optimization algorithm here. For any greedy algorithm (gradient descent, hill climbing, simulated annealing with low temperature etc.) we can divide the problem into \"basins\". If we are anywhere in a basin, we will eventually converge to that basin's local optimum with our greedy algorithm. So, we can formulate global optimization as two problems:-\n",
    "\n",
    "1: find the basin which contains the global optimum\n",
    "\n",
    "2: then find the optimum within that basin\n",
    "\n",
    "If we assume that basins are approximately flat and of equal size, we can reframe step 1 as the secretary problem: we \"interview\" basins in a random order by dividing the space with grid search then sampling randomly, rejecting the first N/e, then we \"hire\" the first basin which is preferable to all the others. Once the basin is \"hired\", we use a greedy algorithm (here, simulated annealing with low temperature) to find the local optimum within that basin."
